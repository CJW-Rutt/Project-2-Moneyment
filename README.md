## Description
Moneyment is a financial management mobile application designed for post-secondary students.

It is fueled by cutting-edge AI technology to transform financial tasks into stress-free and seamless experiences.

Users are able to smoothly track their transactions by scanning their receipts. The AI will then scan the receipt and automatically parse the details into a form which the user can review before submitting.

We know developing financial literacy can be overwhelming, so Moneyment features an AI chat with which users can ask for advice on money management and developing financial literacy.

Built with usability in mind, Moneyment follows a simple and intuitive design that is also available in dark mode, paired with visualized data to help users stay on track with their financial goals at a glance.
